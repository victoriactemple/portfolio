          <p>Before attending GA, my finance and I hiked every weekend. We've been to dozens of parks in every pockets of Georgia. One of the more frustrating things planning for a hike is researching up-to-date and honest information about the park and its trails. When you do find information, it's usually attached to a website with design and information from the early aughts. Enter Georgia State Park Highlights. The app was built using React on Rails and provides a short list of the top best state parks in Georgia, with each park containing a list of user submitted trails and comments. Through using the Open Weather Map API the user can see the park's up-to-date weather on the specific park page.</p>

          <p>We're selling pies here, so we have a users section for the users to create an account and a pies section where the users, signed in or not, can see all the pies on sale. They can read their descriptions and see their price and even write a review. One of my favorite little attributes to the site is on the individual pie page -- it had a toggle that when clicked will reveal a review form. After completing a title and description, the review will pop up on the screen right under the pie. Once the user hits hide, then the form will hide again.</p>
